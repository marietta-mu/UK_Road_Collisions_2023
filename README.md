## The Main Characteristics of Road Collisions in the UK for 2023

This analysis aims to explore the circumstances of UK road collisions in the year 2023 based on Road Safety data publicly available on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data). The raw data contains 104,258 entries and 40 variables, including:
- the number of vehicles and the number of casualties involved
- the severity of the accident
- the date and exact location of the accident
- the local authority district and national highway authority
- the road and weather conditions, and other factors

What were the main characteristics and possible contributing factors to road collisions in 2023? Are there any patterns for when and where most collisions occurred? What other potential elements, such as speed, road type or weather conditions, were at play? Is there a correlation between these elements and the severity of accidents?

It is crucial to have an overview and gain a good understanding of the potential main contributing factors of these events to help prevent as many accidents in the future as possible.
